Purpose of the program: This program acts as a social site where a user can register an account, log in, like artworks, follow artists, add artworks and receive notifications
similar to how they would in most social media accounts. 

Compilation Instructions: 
Unzip the folder and open it in VS Code or any text editor. Open the terminal and type the following commands followed by hitting Enter: "npm install express",
“npm install express-session”, “npm install mongoose” and “npm install pug”. After installing these dependencies, to run the server type "node server.js". This will log to the
terminal a link to the site’s URL that you can follow or copy and paste in any browser to interact with the webpage.

Installing/Initializing Database and Server:
Before the server should be run, make sure the dependencies for the program are installed by typing the commands: “npm install express”, “npm install express-session”, “npm install
mongoose” and “npm install pug” into the terminal followed by hitting Enter. The database for this project is stored using mongoose and the initialization script is written in the
database-initializer.js file. The code in the file first drops any existing users and gallery collection before importing all the artwork objects from the gallery.json file into the gallery collection. This
implementation results in the database’s collections being dropped and imported again each time the server is restarted. The users collection will be empty each time the server begins and
will only be populated every time a user registers for an account. The gallery collection will always contain at minimum 12 artwork objects added from the beginning. To start the server,
type “node server.js” into the terminal.
